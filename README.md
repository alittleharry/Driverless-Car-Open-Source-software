Instal LIDAR system, short for Light Detection and Ranging system provides accurate 3D information on the surrounding environment Using this data, the processor implements object identification, motion vector determination, collision prediction, and avoidance strategies. The LIDAR unit is well-suited to "big picture" imaging, and provides the needed 360⁰ view by using a rotating, scanning mirror assembly on the top of the car. The data collected would be used to calculate the vehicles' position, speed, and direction relative to these external objects

Install central processing unit to process all information and make decisions

BC™ 30 Wireless Backup Camera

Keep a Watchful Eye on What’s Behind You

    Shows what’s behind your vehicle when in reverse
    View footage right on your GPS navigator’s display* (sold separately)
    Wire to constant power and toggle easily between camera and navigation modes
    Wirelessly transmits video up to 45 feet
    Rugged enough to withstand harsh weather

A quality backup camera like the Garmin BC 30 can significantly enhance rearward visibility for drivers and, thus, help minimize the risk of “blind zone” accidents whenever your vehicle is moving in reverse.
Take the Worry out of Backing Up

When paired with a compatible GPS navigator, the BC 30 wireless backup camera helps you easily spot vehicles, pedestrians, pets and other hard-to-see obstructions behind your vehicle. If the camera is wired to your reverse lights for power, your navigator can automatically display camera footage every time the vehicle is shifted into reverse – and go back into navigation mode when shifted into a forward gear.
See Clearly What Needs to be Seen

As another option, you can wire the system to constant power, which allows you to toggle between the navigation display and backup display modes at the press of a button. The transmitter will send camera footage to your navigator’s receiver mounted up to 45 feet (13.7 meters) away (range varies based on installation; some vehicles may require an extension cable,


Drop-in Autonomy Kit (DAK)
Rapidly transform any car or truck into an automated self-driving vehicle using a drop-in kit.

The Drop-in Autonomy Kit (DAK) is a system for outfitting existing vehicles with autonomous and remote control driving capabilities. The kit includes all of the actuators, sensors, electronics, and software needed in one package. The DAK allows for a 30 minute or less install into any vehicle and allows for an operator to sit in the driver's seat.

DAK system key features:

    Steering, brake, and throttle control
    Installs in any vehicle in 30 minutes or less
    Programmatic fully autonomous navigation
    Route and trajectory planning
    Sophisticated maneuver planning
    Comfortably accommodate operator in driver's seat
    Fully autonomous with a remote tele-operation option
    
    dak adapters/components

The DAK includes a family of adapters for different pedal styles as well as adjustable components to fit various cabin layouts. The steering force reaction stand anchors firmly in the rear of the vehicle, leaving ample room for vehicle passengers and equipment.

Man and Machine

While the DAK delivers fully autonomous operation, sometimes you want to have a human ride along in the driver's seat. The placement of the DAK pedal actuators and steering force reaction stand allow for a person to sit comfortably in the driver's seat and, if needed, take control of the vehicle at any time with the press of a button.

Local or Global Positioning

The DAK includes sensors for position, heading and speed as well as a ruggedized computer with software for navigation and control. The DAK is not limited to GPS for position information. For testing that requires tunable precision or indoor/covered track operation, the DAK is available with an alternative local positioning system called Locata™. Locata uses a constellation of LocataLite™ units that you can use where you want, when you want. Locata™ allows the DAK to deliver tunable accuracy indoors or outdoors, rain or shine, 24/7.

Control and Navigation Software

The DAK system includes an embedded computer with software for defining and controlling your tests, as well as transferring and reviewing data.  The DAK software also performs real-time tasks for autonomous self-navigation and bot-to-bot communication. The DAK was developed based on requirements from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and features software support for performing tests, including NHTSA Crash-Imminent Braking (CIB), NHTSA Dynamic Brake Support (DBS), Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and others.

Built using the MAX™ general purpose robotics and automated vehicle operating system, the DAK inherits a long legacy of sophisticated fully autonomous robotics functions, maneuvers, and programmable behaviors.
