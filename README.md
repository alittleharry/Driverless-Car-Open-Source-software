# Driverless-Car-Open-Source-software

Car driving open source software which could work with any type/make of car 
Requirements
Curate all the available best technologies and make them work together

Determine location--- leverage Garmin GPS 
Determine Road objects Traffic lights, road signs, road lane markings---leverage sensors installed around car
Determine car condition---leverage car dashboard data 

Instal LIDAR system, short for Light Detection and Ranging system provides accurate 3D information on the surrounding environment Using this data, the processor implements object identification, motion vector determination, collision prediction, and avoidance strategies. The LIDAR unit is well-suited to "big picture" imaging, and provides the needed 360‚Å∞ view by using a rotating, scanning mirror assembly on the top of the car. The data collected would be used to calculate the vehicles' position, speed, and direction relative to these external objects

Install central processing unit to process all information and make decisions

Leverage IBM Watson capabilities

Leverage SAP HANA in memory database
