Drop-in Autonomy Kit (DAK)
Rapidly transform any car or truck into an automated self-driving vehicle using a drop-in kit.

The Drop-in Autonomy Kit (DAK) is a system for outfitting existing vehicles with autonomous and remote control driving capabilities. The kit includes all of the actuators, sensors, electronics, and software needed in one package. The DAK allows for a 30 minute or less install into any vehicle and allows for an operator to sit in the driver's seat.

DAK system key features:

    Steering, brake, and throttle control
    Installs in any vehicle in 30 minutes or less
    Programmatic fully autonomous navigation
    Route and trajectory planning

    dak adapters/components

The DAK includes a family of adapters for different pedal styles as well as adjustable components to fit various cabin layouts. The steering force reaction stand anchors firmly in the rear of the vehicle, leaving ample room for vehicle passengers and equipment.

Man and Machine

While the DAK delivers fully autonomous operation, sometimes you want to have a human ride along in the driver's seat. The placement of the DAK pedal actuators and steering force reaction stand allow for a person to sit comfortably in the driver's seat and, if needed, take control of the vehicle at any time with the press of a button.

Local or Global Positioning

The DAK includes sensors for position, heading and speed as well as a ruggedized computer with software for navigation and control. The DAK is not limited to GPS for position information. For testing that requires tunable precision or indoor/covered track operation, the DAK is available with an alternative local positioning system called Locata™. Locata uses a constellation of LocataLite™ units that you can use where you want, when you want. Locata™ allows the DAK to deliver tunable accuracy indoors or outdoors, rain or shine, 24/7.

Control and Navigation Software

The DAK system includes an embedded computer with software for defining and controlling your tests, as well as transferring and reviewing data.  The DAK software also performs real-time tasks for autonomous self-navigation and bot-to-bot communication. The DAK was developed based on requirements from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and features software support for performing tests, including NHTSA Crash-Imminent Braking (CIB), NHTSA Dynamic Brake Support (DBS), Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and others.

Built using the MAX™ general purpose robotics and automated vehicle operating system, the DAK inherits a long legacy of sophisticated fully autonomous robotics functions, maneuvers, and programmable behaviors.

What is MAX?

In short, MAX is the brain of a self-driving car or robot. MAX is a software platform engineered to make building new autonomous solutions fast and efficient. Using our graphical interface, MAX allows engineers to create autonomous solutions by snapping together pieces much like building with Legos. MAX works with all sensors regardless of brand and type to provide your solution with a comprehensive picture of the road and environment. Further, MAX works with all types of control systems for your autonomous vehicle including drive-by-wire and mechanical actuators. Unlike our competitors, MAX is real-time capable, has a path to ISO certification, and is a "full-stack" comprehensive autonomous vehicle software platform. MAX allows you to develop a solution that works not only in your lab and your test track but also in commercial production applications without requiring any rewrites.

MAX stands for Mobile Autonomous 'X', whereby 'X' is a variable in which a robotics designer can define and create their robotics application of choice. 

Rapid Development

MAX’s development user interface supports configuration of a new autonomous system in minutes. Simply use our graphical interface to select your sensors and control systems from the provided library and just drop it on your vehicle and hit the road! 

Simulation Capability

Our solution includes an optional simulator toolset that allows you to test your autonomous vehicle under real-world conditions including sun, rain, snow, ice, and darkness. Nothing can compare to physical testing, but our simulation solution can help reduce development cycles and cost by letting your team test quickly and safely from their very own desk.

Runs from Day 1

With the included autonomous application, you will be ready to drive your vehicle without the need to write a single line of code. MAX handles all of the critical operating functions including logging, security, and system management so you don’t have to.

Road-Ready

MAX has operated in real-time environments for over a decade and has been tested with all major real-time operating systems. Further, MAX was built as a production grade system from day 1 and is in the process of certification as ISO 26262 ASIL x compliant. MAX is the one solution that works from the test bench to the test track to the manufacturing line without ever needing a rewrite.

Flexible

While MAX includes all required functions out of the box, you can quickly insert your own custom algorithms and logic into MAX. That way your existing investments in your current software can be re-used. MAX's layered architecture and robust API give you the flexibility to pick and choose what MAX will do and what parts you want to do yourself.

Brakes: If a vehicle is equipped with dynamic stability control then software control of the brakes is possible. Dynamic stability control incorporates all the needed pieces to operate the brakes without driver input. The base software will not incorporate software brake control and will require hacking to incorporate the feature. If a vehicle does not have dynamic stability control it will need a third party system that can press the brake pedal.

Throttle: With the incorporation of throttle by wire the task has become far easier. There are provisions for accepting commands to control the throttle for diagnostic purposes. The latency can vary among systems. It may be necessary to hack the software to incorporate a direct bridge to the throttle commands. If the vehicle does not have throttle by wire it may be possible to use cruise control to substitute. Cruise controls operation at low speed and low throttle angle tends to be unstable and jittery. I would recommend installing a third party actuator.

Steering: If a vehicle has electric power steering then it may be possible to have software controlled steering. These systems measure the torque from the steering wheel and then apply the same torque but in the opposite direction for a net torque of zero. They incorporate a steering angle sensor. As with just about everything else hacking the software would be required. If the vehicle does not have electric power steering (hydro electric does not count) the a third party actuator would be required.

Shifter: Many cars now incorporate fully electronic transmission controls. These would be totally software controllable. Other transmissions have electronic control but still retain a physical shifter. The physical shifter incorporates a connection to the transmission to operate the parking paw. In this and all other cases a third party actuator would be required to operate the shifter.

The 'software' loop is described below.

Capture Image: The software captures the image from the webcam using classes and methods available in the java media framework.
Filter Colour: Then, the captured image is put through a simple colour filter - the orange stickers remain orange, everything else is changed to black.
Dilate and Shrink: In order to coalesce the edges of the image of each sticker, the orange part of the image is dilated (black pixels next to orange ones are changed to orange), then shrunk (orange pixels near black ones are changed to black). This ensures that a stray pixel near the edge of an image of a sticker is not counted as a very small sticker.
Detect Regions: Using a simple region-filling algorithm, the orange pixels are collected into groups, each group (hopefully) representing one sticker.
Apply Geometry: The centre and size of each group is measured. The large one is assumed to be the goal, the other five to be the four corners and the front of the car. From this, the software finds the distance and angle from car to goal, and the orientation of the car. The software doesn't bother with real-world coordinates, it measures everything in pixels.
Decide Strategy: Knowing the relative positions of the car and goal, the software applies a set of rules to decide what to do. An example might be if distance is LARGE and angle is between -5 to 5, then move straight forward.
Drive! Once the decision is made, the appropriate commands are sent to the interface board. The software waits for a reasonable amount of time, captures another webcam image, and the software loop begins again.
