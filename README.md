Instal LIDAR system, short for Light Detection and Ranging system provides accurate 3D information on the surrounding environment Using this data, the processor implements object identification, motion vector determination, collision prediction, and avoidance strategies. The LIDAR unit is well-suited to "big picture" imaging, and provides the needed 360⁰ view by using a rotating, scanning mirror assembly on the top of the car. The data collected would be used to calculate the vehicles' position, speed, and direction relative to these external objects

Install central processing unit to process all information and make decisions
